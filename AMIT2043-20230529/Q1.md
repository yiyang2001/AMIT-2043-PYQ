# Question 1

Aaron is a junior web developer, and he has recently been tasked to build an e-commerce application for a pet store. The store owner has provided Aaron with a comprehensive list of requirements, including showcasing products, processing orders, and accepting payment securely. He has decided to build the web application with a user-friendly interface and a scalable backend using PHP and MySQL.

**Part (a)**

Based on the scenario above, identify a suitable category of dynamic web pages that Aaron can use to achieve the requirements specified by the pet store owner. Then support your answer with appropriate justifications.

**Part (b)**

With a diagram, explain the steps on how the dynamic web page identified in Question 1 a) is processed.

**Part (c)**

Based on the dynamic web page identified in Question 1 a), examine the response speed and performance of the page.

**Part (d)**

Aaron plans to apply both categories of dynamic web pages to the e-commerce application. Discuss with Aaron the benefit of utilizing both categories of dynamic web pages in the project.

**Part (e)**

Suggest a suitable protocol for Aaron to allow data exchange in his e-commerce application through the web. Justify your suggestion with proper explanations.

## Solution:

**Part (a)**

Suitable category of dynamic web pages:

Aaron should use server-side dynamic web pages to achieve the requirements specified by the pet store owner. This category of dynamic web pages is processed on the server before the page is sent to the client’s browser. The content of these pages can be changed dynamically based on user input, database queries, or other server-side operations.

Justification:

- Scalability: Server-side dynamic pages can handle a large number of requests and can be scaled up efficiently.
- Security: Sensitive operations such as processing orders and accepting payments are more secure when handled on the server-side.
- Database Interaction: PHP and MySQL are well-suited for interacting with databases, allowing dynamic retrieval and manipulation of product information.

**Part (b)**

Diagram and explanation of the process:

```yaml
Client Browser
    |
    | 1. Request dynamic page
    |
    V
Web Server (with PHP)
    |
    | 2. PHP processes the request
    |
    V
Database (MySQL)
    |
    | 3. Retrieve/Update data
    |
    V
Web Server
    |
    | 4. Send generated HTML
    |
    V
Client Browser
    |
    | 5. Display dynamic content
```

Explanation:

1. The client’s browser sends a request for a dynamic page to the web server.
2. The web server processes the request using PHP, which may involve executing scripts.
3. PHP interacts with the MySQL database to retrieve or update data as required by the request.
4. The server generates an HTML page with the dynamic content based on the database response.
5. The generated HTML is sent back to the client’s browser, where it is displayed.

**Part (c)**

Response speed and performance:

The response speed and performance of server-side dynamic web pages depend on several factors:

- Server Load: The speed of response can be affected by the server load. High traffic can slow down the processing time.
- Database Optimization: Efficient database queries and indexing can improve performance.
- Caching: Implementing caching mechanisms can significantly enhance the response time by storing frequently accessed data temporarily.
- Code Efficiency: Optimized PHP code ensures faster processing and reduces server load.

**Part (d)**

Benefits of utilizing both categories of dynamic web pages:

- Flexibility: Combining client-side and server-side dynamic pages provides flexibility in handling various tasks. For instance, client-side pages can be used for quick, interactive features without reloading the page, while server-side pages handle complex tasks like database interactions.
- Improved User Experience: Client-side dynamic pages enhance user experience by providing instant feedback and reducing server load for tasks that do not require server-side processing.
- Enhanced Security: Server-side processing ensures that sensitive operations like payment processing are secure.
- Load Distribution: Utilizing both types can distribute the processing load more efficiently, improving the overall performance of the application.

**Part (e)**

Suitable protocol for data exchange:

Aaron should use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) for data exchange in his e-commerce application.

Justification:

- Security: HTTPS encrypts data transferred between the client and server, ensuring that sensitive information like payment details is secure from eavesdropping and tampering.
- Trust: Users are more likely to trust a website that uses HTTPS, as indicated by the padlock icon in the browser’s address bar.
- Data Integrity: HTTPS ensures data integrity, meaning that the data sent and received is not altered during transmission.
