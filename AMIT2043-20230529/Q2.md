## Answer

**Part (a)**

Three rules when declaring a variable in PHP:

1. Variable Naming: A variable name must start with a dollar sign ($) followed by a letter or an underscore. It cannot start with a number.

```php
$variableName;
$_variableName;
```

2. Case Sensitivity: Variable names are case-sensitive. For example, $Variable and $variable are considered different variables.

```php
$Variable = "Hello";
$variable = "World";
```

3. No Spaces or Special Characters: Variable names cannot contain spaces or special characters, except for the underscore (_).

```php
$my_variable;
```

**Part (b)**

Default value of an uninitialized PHP variable:
If a PHP variable is declared without assigning a value, its default value is NULL.

**Part (c)**

Difference between a regular variable and a constant variable in PHP:

- Regular Variable: A regular variable can have its value changed during the execution of the script.

```php
$variable = "Hello";
$variable = "World"; // Value changed
```

- Constant Variable: A constant variable is defined using the define() function or the const keyword and its value cannot be changed once set.

```php
define("CONSTANT_VAR", "Hello");
const CONSTANT_VAR_2 = "World";
// CONSTANT_VAR = "New Value"; // This will cause an error
```

**Part (d)**

Example of a ternary operator and its usage:
The ternary operator is a shorthand for the if-else statement. It is used to assign a value to a variable based on a condition.

```php
$age = 20;
$isAdult = ($age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";
```

When to use: The ternary operator should be used when you need a concise way to assign a value based on a simple condition.
When to prevent: Avoid using the ternary operator for complex conditions or when the readability of the code is compromised.

**Part (e)**

PHP code to declare an array, sort it, and display in an unordered list:

```php
<?php
$students = array("Yan Yong", "Abu", "Vengados", "Yaa Ter");

// Sort the array in descending order
rsort($students);

// Display the names in an unordered list
echo "<ul>";
foreach ($students as $student) {
    echo "<li>$student</li>";
}
echo "</ul>";
?>
```
