## Answers

**Part (a)**

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is used for transmitting web pages over the internet but <mark>does not encrypt the data</mark>, making it <mark>vulnerable</mark>. It uses <mark>port 80</mark> for communication.
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is HTTP with <mark>encryption</mark> and <mark>uses SSL/TLS</mark> to secure the data transfer</mark>, ensuring that data is encrypted and <mark>secure</mark> from eavesdroppers. It uses <mark>port 443</mark> for communication. 

| HTTP | HTTPS |
| --- | --- |
| Unencrypted | Encrypted |
| Uses port 80 | Uses port 443 |
| Vulnerable to attacks | Secure data transfer |
| No SSL/TLS | Uses SSL/TLS for encryption |

**Part (b)**

(i) The main purpose of a stateful protocol is to <mark>maintain the state or context of a session between the client and server</mark>. This allows the server to <mark>remember information</mark> about the ongoing <mark>interaction</mark>, such as user-specific data, session history, and context, to provide a <mark>personalized and continuous experience</mark> for the user. 

For example, in a shopping cart application, the server needs to remember the items added to the cart, the user's login status, and other session-specific information to provide a seamless shopping experience.

> [!NOTE]
> Stateless protocols do not maintain the state of the interaction, treating each request as independent, which can be inefficient for maintaining context and session information. 
> For example, HTTP is a stateless protocol, and each request is processed independently without any knowledge of previous requests. 


(ii) Stateful protocols meet this purpose by <mark>establishing and maintaining a session or connection between the client and server</mark>, allowing them to <mark>exchange information</mark> and <mark>maintain the state</mark> of the interaction throughout the session.

**Part (c)**

1. Client sends a request: The web client (browser) sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the web server.
2. Server processes the request: The web server receives the request, processes it, and retrieves the requested resource (e.g., HTML page, data from a database).
3. Server sends a response: The web server sends the HTTP/HTTPS response back to the web client, including the requested resource.
4. Client renders the response: The web client receives the response and renders the content on the user's screen.

**Part (d)**

1. Personalization: Dynamic web pages can be tailored to individual users, <mark>displaying personalized content based on user preferences, behaviors, and interactions</mark>.
2. Interactivity: Dynamic web pages can include <mark>interactive elements such as forms, animations, and real-time updates</mark>, enhancing user engagement and providing a richer user experience.
3. Content Management: Dynamic web pages allow for <mark>easy content management and updates</mark>, enabling website owners to <mark>add, edit, and remove content dynamically</mark> without changing the underlying structure of the web page.
4. Integration with Databases: Dynamic web pages can <mark>retrieve and display data from databases</mark>, enabling <mark>dynamic content generation</mark> based on user input or database queries.
