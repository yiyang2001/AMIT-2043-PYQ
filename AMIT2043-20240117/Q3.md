# Q3 Past Year Question and Answer

## Question

**Part (a)**

Based on the following PHP codes, create a sticky form for the Name and Email fields. 

```php
$name = $_POST["name"];
$email = $_POST["email"];
```

```html
<form method="" action="">
    Name: <input type="text" name="name">

    <input type="submit" name="submit">
</form>
```

**Part (b)**

Answer the following questions based on the table named "campus" shown in Table 2. The table has been created and stored in the MySQL database.

Table 2: campus

| C2 | Johor |
| C3 | Pahang |
| C4 | Penang |
| C5 | Perak |
| C6 | Sabah |

(i) Write PHP codes to connect the MySQL database with the following information and disconnect it if the connection fails. (7 marks)
```text
Username = tarumt
Password = 123
Database = tarumtDB
Host = localhost
```
(ii) Write SQL codes to search the Campus table with a specific CampusID ($CampusID) submitted by a user. Assign it to a PHP variable $sql_searchCampus. (3 marks)

(iii) Based on the codes written in Question 3b) (i) and Question 3b) (ii), write PHP codes to query the database (tarumtDB). Assign the query result to a PHP variable named $result_searchCampus. (2 marks)

(iv) Write PHP codes to display the campus name (Campus Name) if the record is found. Otherwise, show the message "Record not found". (5 marks)

(v) Write PHP codes to update "KL" to "Kuala Lumpur". Assign the codes of updating to a PHP variable named $sql_updateCampus, and the query result to a PHP variable named $result_updateCampus. (5 marks)

## Answer

**Part (a)**

```php
<?php
// Check if the form is submitted
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
    // Get the form values
    $name = htmlspecialchars($_POST["name"]);
    $email = htmlspecialchars($_POST["email"]);
} else {
    // Initialize variables if the form is not submitted
    $name = "";
    $email = "";
}
?>
```

```html
<form method="post" action="">
    Name: <input type="text" name="name" value="<?php echo $name; ?>">
    Email: <input type="text" name="email" value="<?php echo $email; ?>">
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

```
> [!NOTE]
> Sticky form is a web form that retains the information entered by the user even after the form is submitted. This is achieved by pre-filling the form fields with the previously entered values.

Exaplantion:

- The PHP code checks if the form is submitted using `$_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST"`.
- If the form is submitted, it retrieves the values of the Name and Email fields using `$_POST["name"]` and `$_POST["email"]`, respectively.
- The `htmlspecialchars()` function is used to prevent XSS attacks by converting special characters to HTML entities. This helps to sanitize the input data. Example: `<` becomes `&lt;`.


**Part (b)**

(i) Connect to the MySQL database and disconnect if the connection fails.

```php
<?php
$host = "localhost";
$username = "tarumt";
$password = "123";
$database = "tarumtDB";

// Create connection
$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database);

// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
?>
```

Explanation:

- The PHP code establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the `mysqli_connect()` function.
- The connection details such as the host, username, password, and database name are provided as parameters to the function.
- If the connection fails, the `die()` function is called to display an error message along with the error description obtained from `mysqli_connect_error()`.
- The `mysqli_connect()` function returns a MySQLi object representing the connection to the database.
- The connection object is stored in the variable `$conn` for further database operations.
- The connection will be automatically closed when the script finishes executing.

(ii) Search the Campus table with a specific CampusID ($CampusID) submitted by a user.

```php
<?php
$CampusID = $_POST['CampusID'];
$sql_searchCampus = "SELECT * FROM campus WHERE CampusID = '$CampusID'";
?>
```

Explanation:

- Obtain CampusID from user input: Assume $CampusID is obtained from user input using the $_POST superglobal.
- SQL query: Construct the SQL query string to search for the specific CampusID in the "campus" table. The WHERE clause is used to filter the records based on the provided CampusID.

(iii) Query the database (tarumtDB) and assign the query result to a PHP variable named $result_searchCampus.

```php
<?php
$result_searchCampus = mysqli_query($conn, $sql_searchCampus);
?>
```

Explanation:
 
- Search Query: Construct the SQL query to search for the specific CampusID in the campus table and execute it using mysqli_query(). Assign the result to $result_searchCampus.

(iv) Display the campus name (Campus Name) if the record is found. Otherwise, show the message "Record not found".

```php
<?php
if (mysqli_num_rows($result_searchCampus) > 0) {
    while($row = mysqli_fetch_array($result_searchCampus)) {
        echo "Campus Name: " . $row["CampusName"] . "<br>";
    }
} else {
    echo "Record not found";
}
?>
```

Explanation:

- Check if any records are found. If records are found, fetch the results using mysqli_fetch_array() and display the campus name. If no records are found, display "Record not found".


(v) Update "KL" to "Kuala Lumpur". Assign the codes of updating to a PHP variable named $sql_updateCampus, and the query result to a PHP variable named $result_updateCampus.

```php
<?php
$sql_updateCampus = "UPDATE campus SET CampusName = 'Kuala Lumpur' WHERE CampusName = 'KL'";
$result_updateCampus = mysqli_query($conn, $sql_updateCampus);
?>
```

Explanation:

-  Construct the SQL query to update the campus name from "KL" to "Kuala Lumpur". Execute the query and assign the result to $result_updateCampus. Check if the update was successful and display an appropriate message.

## Complete Code

```php
<?php
// Re-establish the database connection if necessary (assuming the previous connection was closed)
$conn = mysqli_connect($host, $username, $password, $database);

// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}

// SQL query to update "KL" to "Kuala Lumpur"
$sql_updateCampus = "UPDATE campus SET CampusName = 'Kuala Lumpur' WHERE CampusName = 'KL'";

// Execute the update query and assign the result to $result_updateCampus
$result_updateCampus = mysqli_query($conn, $sql_updateCampus);

// Check if the update was successful
if ($result_updateCampus) {
    echo "Record updated successfully";
} else {
    echo "Error updating record: " . mysqli_error($conn);
}

// Close the connection
mysqli_close($conn);
?>
```
