# Q3 Past Year Question and Answer

## Original Question

**Part (a)**

(i) Create an HTML hyperlink (URL) that is linked to search.php and the URL carries the following query strings:

- prodID = N101
- prodName = Nike

(Hint: `<a href></a>`)

(ii) Write PHP code to receive and display the above two strings.
(Hint: `<?php echo ?>`)

**Part (b)**

Given the following table (see Table 1) named Product stored in MySQL.

| Prod ID | Prod Name |
| --- | --- |
| N101 | Nike |
| N102 | Adidas |
| N103 | Converse |
| N104 | Puma |

(i) Write PHP codes to connect the MySQL database with the following information and disconnect it if it encounters an error.

- Username = Oscar
- Password = man
- Database = testDB
- Host = localhost

(ii) Write SQL code to select the Product table with a product ID ($prodID) submitted by a user. Assign it to a PHP variable $sql_searchRecord.

(iii) Write PHP code to query the MySQL database with the connection (part (i)) and the SQL (part (ii)).

(iv) Write PHP code to search the database, and then display the product name (Prod_Name) if the record is found. Otherwise, show the message "Record not found".

**Part (c)**

Compare the function of include and require in calling external files.

**Part (d)**

Discuss TWO (2) main differences between cookie and session.

## Answer

**Part (a)**

(i) HTML hyperlink:

```html
<a href="search.php?prodID=N101&prodName=Nike">Search Product</a>
```

Explanation: This HTML hyperlink will direct the user to the search.php page with the query strings `prodID=N101` and `prodName=Nike`.

(ii) PHP code to receive and display the query strings:

```php
<?php
    echo "Product ID: " . $_GET['prodID'] . "<br>";
    echo "Product Name: " . $_GET['prodName'];
?>
```

Explanation: This PHP code retrieves the query strings `prodID` and `prodName` from the URL and displays them on the page.

**Part (b)**

(i) PHP code to connect to MySQL:

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "Oscar";
$password = "man";
$dbname = "testDB";

// Create connection
$conn = mysqli_connect($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

// Check connection
if (!$conn) {
    die("Connection failed: " . mysqli_connect_error());
}
?>
```

Explanation: This PHP code establishes a connection to the MySQL database using the provided credentials. It also checks if the connection is successful and displays an error message if it fails.

(ii) SQL code to select the product:

```php
$prodID = $_POST['prodID']; // Assuming the product ID is submitted via POST method
$sql_searchRecord = "SELECT * FROM Product WHERE Prod_ID = '$prodID'";
```

Explanation: 
- The PHP variable `$prodID` is assigned the value of the product ID submitted by the user.
- The SQL query selects all columns from the Product table where the Prod_ID matches the submitted product ID.

(iii) PHP code to query the MySQL database:

```php
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql_searchRecord);
?>
```

Explanation:
- The PHP code executes the SQL query using the established database connection.
- `mysqli_query()` function is used to perform the query.

(iv) Full PHP code for search and display:

```php
<?php
if (mysqli_num_rows($result) > 0) {
    while ($row = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result)) {
        echo "Product Name: " . $row["Prod_Name"];
    }
} else {
    echo "Record not found";
}
mysqli_close($conn);
?>
```

Explanation:
- `mysqli_num_rows()` function checks if any records are returned.
- `mysqli_fetch_assoc()` function retrieves the data from the result set.
- If the record is found, it displays the product name. Otherwise, it shows a message indicating that the record was not found.


**Part (c)**

Comparison of include and require:

- include: This statement includes and evaluates the specified file. If the file is not found, it will emit a warning but the script will continue execution.
- require: This statement is identical to include, except upon failure it will also produce a fatal error and stop the script execution.

In summary, include is more lenient and allows the script to continue execution even if the file is not found, while require is stricter and will halt the script if the file is not found.

| include | require |
| --- | --- |
| Produces a warning if the file is not found | Produces a fatal error if the file is not found |
| Allows the script to continue execution | Halts the script execution if the file is not found |

**Part (d)**

Differences between cookie and session:

- Storage Location:
  - Cookie: Stored on the client's browser.
  - Session: Stored on the server.
- Lifetime:
  - Cookie: Can persist for a long time, depending on the expiration time set.
  - Session: Typically lasts until the user closes the browser or the session times out on the server.

In summary, cookies are stored on the client-side and can have a longer lifespan, while sessions are stored on the server-side and are typically temporary.

|  | Cookie | Session |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Storage Location | Client-side (browser) | Server-side |
| Lifetime | Can persist for a long time | Typically temporary |
