# Q1 Past Year Question and Answer
## Original Question

**Part (a)**
Clearly describe the process of interaction between a web client and a web server to retrieve and display web pages. Your answer should include the following information:

- URL
- http/https
- port numbers
- DNS
- http request message
- TCP/IP
- server-side scripts
- http response message
- status code (e.g. 200 and 404)
(17 marks)

**Answer:**

- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator):** The process begins when a user enters a URL into their web browser. The URL specifies the address of the web resource the user wants to access.

- **HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol/Secure):** The browser uses HTTP or HTTPS (for secure communication) to request the web resource. HTTPS is HTTP with encryption, providing secure data transfer.

- **Port Numbers:** The web client connects to the web server through specific port numbers. The default port for HTTP is 80 and for HTTPS is 443.

- **DNS (Domain Name Server):** The browser sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name in the URL to an IP address. DNS translates the human-readable domain into an IP address that the browser can use to locate the web server.

- **HTTP Request Message:** The browser constructs an HTTP request message, which includes methods like GET or POST, and sends it to the server. The request message contains the URL, headers, and may include a body with data (for POST requests).

- **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):** The request message is sent over the internet using the TCP/IP protocol. TCP ensures reliable delivery of the message by establishing a connection and managing the data packets.

- **Server-Side Scripts:** Upon receiving the request, the web server processes it using server-side scripts (e.g., PHP, Node.js). These scripts can access databases, process data, and generate the appropriate response.

- **HTTP Response Message:** The server sends back an HTTP response message, which includes a status line (with status code), headers, and optionally a body containing the requested resource (e.g., HTML content).

- **Status Code:** The status code in the response message indicates the result of the request. Common codes include 200 (OK, resource found and sent) and 404 (Not Found, resource not available).

**Part (b)**
"Dynamic web pages are more preferable than static web pages". Provide FOUR (4) key points to justify the statement above.
(8 marks)

**Answer:**

- **Interactivity:** Dynamic web pages allow for user interaction, such as form submissions, comments, and personalized content. This enhances user engagement and provides a more personalized experience.

- **Real-time Updates:** Dynamic pages can be updated in real-time without needing to reload the entire page. This is crucial for applications like social media, news sites, and online stores, where content changes frequently.

- **Content Management:** Dynamic pages often integrate with content management systems (CMS) that make it easier to update and manage website content. Non-technical users can update the site without needing to edit HTML files directly.

- **Scalability:** Dynamic web pages can adapt to different user needs and contexts. For example, they can display different content based on user preferences, location, or behavior. This scalability is beneficial for large, complex websites.
