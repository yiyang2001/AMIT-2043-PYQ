# Question 4

**Part (a)**

Write PHP code to set a cookie for the following items:

- Name => Tom
- Member ID => T123

The cookie will be expired after 1 hour. Verify the cookie by displaying the cookieâ€™s name and value. Otherwise, show an error message e.g. Cookie is not set or expired!
(Hint: `setcookie`, `isset`, `$_COOKIE`)

**Part (b)**

Provide an explanation of jQuery and demonstrate its practical application in web development.[4 marks] (Hint: AJAX, DOM manipulation, event handling, animation)

**Part (c)**

Write a jQuery to hide the paragraph when it is clicked. (Hint: `p`, `.click()`, `.hide()`) [4 marks]

**Part (d)**

Describe the operation of Ajax technology. [4 marks]

**Part (e)**

Given the HTML tags as follows:

```html
<button id="ajaxButton">Click Me</button>
<div id="myDiv"></div>
```

Write a jQuery Ajax using `load` to read a text file `ajax_text.txt`. Then, display the content within the division `myDiv` when `Click Me` button is clicked.
(Hint: `.ready()`, `.click()`, `.load(...function())`)

## Solution:

**Part (a)**

PHP code to set and verify the cookie:

```php
<?php
// Setting the cookies
setcookie("Name", "Tom", time() + 3600); // 1 hour expiration
setcookie("MemberID", "T123", time() + 3600); // 1 hour expiration

// Verifying the cookies
if(isset($_COOKIE['Name']) && isset($_COOKIE['MemberID'])) {
    echo "Name: " . $_COOKIE['Name'] . "<br>";
    echo "Member ID: " . $_COOKIE['MemberID'];
} else {
    echo "Cookie is not set or expired!";
}
?>
```

Explanation:

- The `setcookie` function is used to set cookies with the specified name, value, and expiration time.
- `isset($_COOKIE['Name'])` checks if the cookie with the name 'Name' is set.
- If both cookies are set, their values are displayed. Otherwise, an error message is shown.

**Part (b)**

Explanation of jQuery:

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation, with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. Practical applications of jQuery in web development include:

Hint: AJAX, DOM manipulation, event handling, animation

- AJAX : Simplifying AJAX calls for asynchronous web requests. 
- DOM manipulation : Manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) easily. 
- Animation: Adding effects and animations to web pages.
- Event Handling: Handling events like clicks, hovers, and form submissions in a consistent manner across browsers.


**Part (c)**

jQuery to hide a paragraph when clicked:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("p").click(function(){
        $(this).hide();
    });
});
```

Explanation:
- `$(document).ready(function(){...})` ensures that the script runs after the document is fully loaded.
- `$("p")` selects all paragraph elements.
- `.click(function(){...})` attaches a click event handler to the selected paragraphs.
- `$(this).hide();` hides the paragraph that was clicked.

**Part (d)**

Operation of Ajax technology:

Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page. The key operations include:

- Creating an XMLHttpRequest object.
- Sending a request to a server.
- Receiving data from the server.
- Updating the web page content based on the server response.

**Part (e)**

jQuery Ajax using load:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("#ajaxButton").click(function(){
        $("#myDiv").load("ajax_text.txt", function(response, status, xhr){
            if(status == "error") {
                $("#myDiv").html("An error occurred: " + xhr.status + " " + xhr.statusText);
            }
        });
    });
});
```

Explanation:
- `$(document).ready(function(){...})` ensures that the script runs after the document is fully loaded.
- `$("#ajaxButton").click(function(){...})` attaches a click event handler to the button with the ID 'ajaxButton'.
- `$("#myDiv").load("ajax_text.txt", function(response, status, xhr){...})` loads the content of 'ajax_text.txt' into the 'myDiv' element.
- The callback function checks the status of the request and displays an error message if an error occurs.
- The content of the text file will be displayed in the 'myDiv' element when the button is clicked.
- The text file 'ajax_text.txt' should be in the same directory as the HTML file.
- The error message will be displayed if the file cannot be loaded.
